                        I am very actively involved at loyola. I represent Loyola in many extra curricular activities such as Basketball, Volleyball, and 
                        I have been proudly selected to represent Loyola as a member of the Maroon and White. 
                        I am also an avid musician. I play saxophone, violin, and piano. I am part of the concert band. I have achieved several academic awards such 
                        as Exemplary Effort Award in Secondary 1, and the Academic Achievement Award in Sec 2,3,4. 
                        I am very perseverant and hard working. I will make sure to use all of my qualities and values as president.
